# 🟢 Matrix-Themed E-Voting System – User Portal

This repository contains the **User Page** for our **Matrix-Themed Secure E-Voting System**, built for a hackathon project.  
The system ensures **privacy, security, and transparency** in digital voting using **encryption, digital identities, and tamper-proof records**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **User Registration**: Voters register with their details and receive a **unique digital identity (UUID)**.
- **Secure Voting**: Cast votes anonymously – no one can trace who voted for whom.
- **Encryption & Decryption**: Votes are encrypted for security and only decrypted at the time of result compilation.
- **Vote Verification**: Each voter can later verify their vote using their **digital identity**.
- **Complete Privacy**: Even the admin cannot see individual voter choices.
- **Matrix-Inspired UI**: Futuristic design with green glowing effects and animations.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend** (planned for integration): Flask / Node.js  
- **Database**: SQLite / MongoDB (for demo, can be swapped)  
- **Encryption**: SHA-256 / AES for secure vote handling  

---

## ⚡ How It Works
1. **User registers** → gets a **unique digital identity**.  
2. **User logs in & casts vote** → vote stored securely (encrypted).  
3. **Vote verification** → users can check their vote with their ID (without revealing it).  
4. **Results released by Admin** → Users see **graphs & PDFs** of election results.  

---

## 🔐 Security Highlights
- End-to-end **encryption of votes**.  
- **Unique UUID per voter** – impossible to duplicate or guess.  
- **Anonymity guaranteed** – no link between user identity & vote.  
- **Tamper-proof storage** – votes cannot be altered once cast.  

---

## 📊 Demo (Hackathon Flow)
- **Admin sets election timeline & candidates** (on Admin Page).  
- **Users access this User Portal** via a shared link.  
- **Voting occurs securely**.  
- **Admin publishes result PDF** → Users can download & view.

## 🖥️ Installation & Run
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/matrix-voting-user.git
cd matrix-voting-user

⚡ I kept this README **hackathon-friendly + professional**. You can directly paste it into your GitHub.  

Do you also want me to make a **separate README for the Admin Page** once you upload that part?
